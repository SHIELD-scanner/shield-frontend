    "description": "A critical remote code execution vulnerability in Redis server that allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands on the host system through Lua script injection. The vulnerability exists in the Redis Lua script sandbox escape mechanism, allowing attackers to break out of the script execution environment and execute system commands with the privileges of the Redis process. This can lead to complete system compromise in environments where Redis runs with elevated privileges or has access to sensitive data.",
