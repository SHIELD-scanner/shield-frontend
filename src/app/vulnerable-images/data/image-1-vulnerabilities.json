    "description": "A critical buffer overflow vulnerability in OpenSSL that could allow remote code execution when processing malformed certificates. This vulnerability affects the X.509 certificate verification process and can be exploited by presenting a specially crafted certificate to a vulnerable application. The flaw allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of allocated memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable process. This is particularly dangerous in web servers and applications that handle TLS connections.",
